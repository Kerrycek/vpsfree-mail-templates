Hi <%= @user.login %>,

we have just accepted payment of <%= @payment.received_amount %> <%= @payment.received_currency.to_s.upcase %> for account <%= @user.id %>.

If you require an invoice for this payment, please reply to this e-mail and ask
for it. We do not issue invoices automatically. Do not forget to include your
billing information, if you're asking for your first invoice.

The membership is now valid until <%= @account.paid_until.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') %>.

Best regards,

vpsAdmin @ vpsFree.cz
