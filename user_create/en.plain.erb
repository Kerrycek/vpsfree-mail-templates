Hi <%= @user.login %>,

this is an automated message from vpsAdmin, the administration system of vpsFree.cz.
It's the first e-mail you receive as a member, so please read it carefully.

You can manage VPS, NAS, playground, payments and many other things in vpsAdmin.

However, before you login, please remember that your VPS is accessible from
the public Internet. Many bots will try to connect to your VPS, guess passwords
and exploit vulnerabilties of frequently used software. It is important not to
underestimate the security: use strong passwords, update your software and do not
transfer your password unencrypted.
